Final Project Proposal:

==Password Cracker Lab==
- Make a faster password cracker, one I can test with longer passwords, and passwords including numbers/uppercase letters.
- Split work between GPU and CPU. Test to find fastest proportions (starting: ~10% CPU, ~90% GPU)
- split work across multiple computers?

==Malloc Lab==
- Working set visualization - use custom malloc(?) and LD_PRELOAD and
mprotect to catch memory accesses by threads. Use to learn which thread
accessed which address. Analyze info to tell user how much/which memory in
a program is shared b/w threads vs. used primarily by one thread, which is
frequently/infrequently accessed, etc.
